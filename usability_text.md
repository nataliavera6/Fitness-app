# Usability tests for the challenges feature 

## **Participants:** Kevin Gomez and Gabriel Morel

## **Introduction:**

Introduce yourself and your team, give the participant a brief overview of their role in the user study and the persona they will be playing while interacting with the application. 

‚Ä¢	My name is Natalia, and I am working on a project with Camia, Donovan, Ariana, and Erick. 

‚Ä¢	We are developing a fitness app and have created a paper prototype that we want you to test.

‚Ä¢	In this document, I have included a list of tasks that you must complete. Pretend that you are a random user and navigate through the app as you must to complete the tasks provided. 

## **Tasks:** 

Provide users with a scenario in which they want to perform a given task. 

‚Ä¢	**Task 1:** Finish a Challenge

~	Scenario: You‚Äôve wish to complete the fitness mission for the week. Find, read, and complete the mission 
* 	**Task:** Find and complete the weekly mission.

*  	**Instructions:** Let me know when you‚Äôve successfully finished the mission and can see the confirmation

‚Ä¢	**Task 2:** Navigate back to main page 

~	Scenario: You‚Äôve completed the fitness mission for the week, and now you want continue viewing your friend‚Äôs posts.
*	**Task:** Navigate back to community page.
*	**Instructions:** Let me know when you‚Äôve successfully returned to the community page.

## **Notes:** 

Take notes of where a user is confused, hesitant, or misunderstanding the experience. These are areas you may want to fix later.

‚Ä¢	**Kevin Gomez**
  -	User 1 was confused as to how to navigate back to home screen. 
  -	User 1 was concerned about the size of the challenge message.

‚Ä¢	**Gabriel Morel**
  -	User 2 was unimpressed with the amount of challenged presented.
  -	User 2 was confused about the steps he should take to complete the challenge.

## **Feedback:** 

After the participant indicates their task is complete, ask them for feedback.

‚Ä¢	**First participant:** Kevin Gomez

~	How easy/hard was it to complete the task given? 
* The task was relatively easy, the user navigated through the app immediately identifying the path to be taken without issues.

~	What confusions were there? Why were they confused? 
* 	The user was not confused as to how to navigate, most of the issues they had with the app were in terms of the UI design not the UX. 
* 	The user had problems navigating back to community page because the return message (‚Äúcommunity page‚Äù) doesn‚Äôt properly indicate the return to the page.

~	What could be improved?
* 	User suggested that we should fix the return message on the congratulations pop-up that currently says, ‚Äúcommunity page‚Äù. Just putting the name ‚Äúcommunity page‚Äù is confusing since the user does not know the name of the page they were previously on. An alternative would be to replace that button with an x at the top right of the message since that clearly expresses the action that the button would take. 
* 	User noticed that the challenge description was too small and should be a pop-up page, like the congratulations message. 

‚Ä¢	**Second Participant:** Gabriel Morel

~	How easy/hard was it to complete the task given? 
* 	The user navigated to the challenges easily but had difficulty with the challenge instructions and concept.

~	What confusions were there? Why were they confused? 
* 	User was confused as to how to go about the challenge and spent more time identifying the title from the instructions than was expected.

~	What could be improved?
* 	User suggested we include multiple challenges so that people could choose between options, he noted that it was discouraging to only see one challenge presented.
* 	User suggested that the challenges have set of steps or instructions and the font size more clearly separates the title of the challenge from the instructions. 


## **Results:** 

After the test, list out the issues/challenges that participants had, hypothesize the reason for each, and list your chosen remedy to improve it. Participant quotes are included.

~	**Issues/challenges:**
1)	Kevin Gomez had issues navigating back to home page. ‚ÄúI have no way of knowing that the page I was in previously is the community page so that button confuses me.‚Äù 
2)	Kevin Gomez had trouble reading the challenge because the text is too small ‚ÄúI feel like the feature doesn‚Äôt stand out to me.‚Äù
3)	Gabriel Morel was confused with the challenge instructions. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me to climb 100 steps, but I don‚Äôt understand what you want from me exactly.‚Äù
4)	Gabriel Morel was unimpressed with the number of challenges presented. ‚ÄúI feel like if I don‚Äôt want to do that, what do I do?‚Äù

~	**Reason/hypothesis:**
1)	The name of the button and its color make it blend in. This means that it is hard to find, and its function is confusing.
2)	The challenge bubble is too small, and it is at the bottom of the page, so it doesn‚Äôt draw attention.
3)	The instructions of the challenges are vague and short to allow for creativity from the user, but this can back-fire since it is supposed to simulate a competition and the user wants to know they are doing it correctly.
4)	Having only one challenge makes frustrates the users who want to be able to have a choice about what they challenge themselves with that week. Additionally, if they complete a challenge early, they don‚Äôt want to wait till next week for the next challenge.

~	**Remedies:**
1)	Replace the ‚Äúcommunity page‚Äù button in the congratulations pop-up to a x button at the top left of the screen.
2)	Once the challenge button is pressed, open a pop-up page with the challenge name and description so that it is unmissable. Similar to the congratulations pop-up, this should have a x button at the top right to leave the page.
3)	Add a dropdown or tabs to outline the instructions or specifications to complete a challenge. 
4)	Add more challenges. We need to add a list of multiple challenges, each of which can be completed in any order. 


# Usability tests for the habit tracker 

## Intro
Hello my name is Erick Constant, I am working on a team with Camia, Donovan, Ariana and Natalia
We are developing a fitness app and have created a paper prototype that we want you to test.
In this, I want you to try to envision useful completeing the tasks set below 
## Tasks
- Task One, Add Water Content
  Participant 1: I like how its clear and conince how to add a new water log. However, I wish that it was in ounces because I am American.
  Participant 2: I like where the buttons are but I wish it was in ounces because this is America. ü¶Ö RAHH
-Task Two: Check your sleep
  Participant 1: I like how I was able to clearly see the current sleep time. 
  Particpant 2: I like how I was able to find the sleep cycle and looking at the past. 

Feedback: "Is there anything we can improve on?"
  Particpant One: The ounces, however I also wanted to see a different blue and see past history of water.
  Participant Two: The ounces thats the mainly it

## Results
Results:
  While my particpants don't seem to have any problems about adding water content or checking the sleep. I believe the main problem with the ounces was only because of the American world, where the entire thing is metric system. Chosen remedies are as followed: change ml to oz, compare past water intakes, darker blue for water
